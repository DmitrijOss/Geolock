# Geolock

Geolock is an application made to provide users with an additional layer of security on their Android devices by placing a PIN lock on selected applications. Geolock allows you to designate certain areas on a map you wish to be protected within and you can then select applications installed on the device that should be protected. If a protected application is launched while inside a protected area then the application will instead redirect you to a lock screen and ask you to input a predetermined pin-code
