/*
TODO: Retrieve a list of all geofences and display information on all them
TODO: Edit any geofence in that list, probably done by getting its information and filling in editTexts with it, then when confirming you delete the old geofence and add in the new one
TODO: Fix error with geofence creation
TODO: Get colour selection working
This'll have me done with the basics of geofences
TODO: Possibly redo the map dialogFragment, add a FAB to it which expands, to make it look fancier.
